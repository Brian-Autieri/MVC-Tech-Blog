# MVC Tech Blog

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a CMS- style blog site for users to create an account, make posts, and comment on other users' posts. This project was created using the Model-View-Controller paradigm, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Usage

To use this application, visit the deployed site with the webpage link below. To run the application locally, clone the repository to your local machine, navigate to the root directory of the project in the terminal, and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then, run `npm start` to start the server. The application will be running at http://localhost:3001/.
